Shooting is the main way to deal damage to other units. You have a Pistol and a Machine Gun at your disposal. 
The Pistol has unlimited ammo but the Machine Gun is limited, so use it wisely!
The default key mappings are 1 to switch to Machine Gun and 2 to switch to Pistol. You can also switch by using the mouse wheel to cycle through your weapons. Use left mouse-click to shoot. These can be changed in the settings.
