# Escort The President


### Introduction
##### Purpose
Escort The President is a game created by Ahmed Bhallo, James Birch, Edward Dean, Brendan Hart and Kwong Hei Tsang for our second year team project.
##### Game Concept
Escort The President is a multiplayer game where each rounds consists of Assassins attempting to assassinate the recently-elect president. Assassins carefully plot their move to kill the president, knowing there's a $2,000,000 bounty awaiting. The president has been followed inside his car and he receives a tip that Assassins are patiently waiting to make their move... Gunshot! An Assassin has shot at the vehicle and the president's Escorts with the aid of Police Officers attempt to escort him to the helicopter alive. To make matters worse, this is in public streets and there are civilians everywhere!
